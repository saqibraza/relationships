# Asymmetric Semantic Textual Similarity (Asym-STS)

A novel approach to measuring directional semantic relationships between Quranic surahs using sentence-level embeddings.

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Asym-STS** provides a more fine-grained asymmetric similarity measure than KL divergence by:
1. Operating at **sentence level** (not document level)
2. Measuring **coverage** (how much of source is found in target)
3. Using **semantic embeddings** (not just word frequencies)

---

## 📐 Mathematical Formulation

### Forward Direction (B → A)

To measure how much of surah B is covered by surah A:

```
Asym-STS(B→A) = (1/|S_B|) × Σ_{s_b ∈ S_B} max_{s_a ∈ S_A} CosineSim(s_b, s_a)
```

Where:
- `S_B` = set of all sentence embeddings from surah B
- `S_A` = set of all sentence embeddings from surah A
- `s_b` = a sentence vector from B
- `s_a` = a sentence vector from A
- `CosineSim(s_b, s_a)` = cosine similarity between two sentence vectors

### Reverse Direction (A → B)

```
Asym-STS(A→B) = (1/|S_A|) × Σ_{s_a ∈ S_A} max_{s_b ∈ S_B} CosineSim(s_a, s_b)
```

### Interpretation

**High Asym-STS(B→A)**: Most sentences in B find strong matches in A  
→ B's content is well-covered by A  
→ B might be a thematic "subset" of A

**Low Asym-STS(A→B)**: Many sentences in A don't find good matches in B  
→ A has content beyond what's in B  
→ A is broader or more diverse than B

## 🔍 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Split Surahs into Sentences

**Important**: The first verse (Bismillah: "بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ") is skipped for all surahs except Surah 9 (At-Tawbah), as it's the same verse repeated across all surahs and would artificially inflate similarity scores.

```python
# Surah A (Al-Baqarah, originally 286 verses, 285 after skipping Bismillah)
sentences_A = [
    # "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم",  # SKIPPED (Bismillah)
    "ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبُ لَا رَيْبَ...",  # Verse 1 after Bismillah
    "ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ...",
    # ... 283 more verses
]

# Surah B (At-Talaq, originally 12 verses, 11 after skipping Bismillah)
sentences_B = [
    # "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم",  # SKIPPED (Bismillah)
    "يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ...",  # Verse 1 after Bismillah
    "فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ...",
    # ... 9 more verses
]

# Surah 9 (At-Tawbah, 129 verses, NO skipping - keeps all verses)
sentences_9 = [
    "بَرَآءَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ...",  # Starts directly (no Bismillah)
    # ... 128 more verses
]
```

#### 2. Encode Each Sentence

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch

# Use AraBERT (default) - optimized for Classical Arabic & Quranic text
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('aubmindlab/bert-base-arabertv02')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('aubmindlab/bert-base-arabertv02')

# Get 768-dimensional vectors for each sentence (after Bismillah exclusion)
# Uses [CLS] token embeddings from AraBERT
embeddings_A = encode_with_arabert(sentences_A)  # Shape: (285, 768) - Bismillah skipped
embeddings_B = encode_with_arabert(sentences_B)  # Shape: (11, 768) - Bismillah skipped
```

#### 3. For Each Sentence in Source, Find Best Match in Target

**Direction B → A** (measuring coverage of B by A):

```python
max_similarities = []

for sentence_b in embeddings_B:  # 11 sentences (Bismillah excluded)
    # Compare to ALL sentences in A
    similarities = cosine_similarity(sentence_b, embeddings_A)  # 285 scores
    
    # Take the MAXIMUM similarity
    best_match = max(similarities)
    max_similarities.append(best_match)

# Average the max similarities
asym_sts_B_to_A = mean(max_similarities)
```

**Example**:
```
Sentence B1: "divorce procedures"
  → Best match in A: "divorce laws" (similarity: 0.92)

Sentence B2: "waiting period rules"
  → Best match in A: "waiting period details" (similarity: 0.95)

Sentence B3: "remarriage conditions"
  → Best match in A: "remarriage regulations" (similarity: 0.89)

...

Average: 0.90 → Asym-STS(B→A) = 90%
```

**Direction A → B** (measuring coverage of A by B):

```python
max_similarities = []

for sentence_a in embeddings_A:  # 285 sentences (Bismillah excluded)
    # Compare to ALL sentences in B
    similarities = cosine_similarity(sentence_a, embeddings_B)  # 11 scores
    
    # Take the MAXIMUM similarity
    best_match = max(similarities)
    max_similarities.append(best_match)

# Average the max similarities
asym_sts_A_to_B = mean(max_similarities)
```

**Example**:
```
Sentence A1: "faith fundamentals"
  → Best match in B: "believing women" (similarity: 0.45) [POOR]

Sentence A2: "prayer regulations"
  → Best match in B: "divorce waiting" (similarity: 0.32) [POOR]

Sentence A3: "fasting rules"
  → Best match in B: "remarriage" (similarity: 0.28) [POOR]

Sentence A50: "divorce procedures"
  → Best match in B: "divorce procedures" (similarity: 0.95) [GOOD]

...

Average: 0.55 → Asym-STS(A→B) = 55%
```

#### 4. Result

```
Asym-STS(B→A) = 90%  [HIGH - B's content is in A]
Asym-STS(A→B) = 55%  [LOWER - A has much beyond B]

Asymmetry = |90% - 55%| = 35%  [STRONGLY ASYMMETRIC]
```

**Interpretation**: Surah B (At-Talaq) is highly focused on divorce, and all its content finds strong matches in the broader Surah A (Al-Baqarah). However, Al-Baqarah contains many themes beyond divorce (faith, prayer, fasting, etc.), so only about half its content matches with At-Talaq.

## 🆚 Comparison with Other Methods

### vs KL Divergence

| Aspect | KL Divergence | Asym-STS |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Granularity** | Document-level word frequencies | Sentence-level embeddings |
| **Semantics** | Bag-of-words (no meaning) | Deep semantic understanding |
| **Asymmetry** | Yes (inherently asymmetric) | Yes (by design) |
| **Interpretation** | Probability distribution divergence | Content coverage |
| **Sensitivity** | Vocabulary overlap | Semantic similarity |

**Example**: Two surahs using different words but same meaning:
- KL Divergence: LOW similarity (different words)
- Asym-STS: HIGH similarity (same meaning)

### vs Document-Level Embeddings

| Aspect | Document Embeddings | Asym-STS |
|--------|---------------------|----------|
| **Representation** | Single vector per surah | Multiple vectors (one per sentence) |
| **Asymmetry** | Cosine similarity is symmetric | Directional matching is asymmetric |
| **Granularity** | Coarse (whole document) | Fine (sentence-level) |
| **Interpretation** | Overall similarity | Coverage measurement |

**Example**: Long vs short surah:
- Document Embeddings: Single similarity score
- Asym-STS: Different scores showing which covers which

### vs N-grams

| Aspect | N-grams | Asym-STS |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Level** | Phrase patterns (2-3 words) | Sentence semantics |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid (exact matches) | Flexible (semantic matches) |
| **Language** | Surface form | Deep meaning |
| **Synonyms** | Missed | Captured |

---

## 💡 Key Advantages

### 1. **Sentence-Level Granularity**

Instead of treating surahs as single documents, Asym-STS analyzes at the verse/sentence level:
- Captures fine-grained thematic structure
- Identifies which specific verses are similar
- More interpretable results

### 2. **True Semantic Understanding**

Uses transformer-based embeddings that understand:
- Synonyms and paraphrases
- Contextual meaning
- Cross-lingual patterns
- Deep semantic relationships

### 3. **Directional Coverage**

Explicitly measures **coverage**:
- "How much of B is found in A?" (B→A)
- "How much of A is found in B?" (A→B)
- Perfect for parent/child relationships

### 4. **Robust Asymmetry**

Produces strong asymmetric signals:
- Long ↔ Short surahs: Clear directional difference
- Broad ↔ Focused surahs: Coverage varies by direction
- General ↔ Specific themes: Natural asymmetry

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### High Asym-STS (Both Directions)

**Surah 113 ↔ 114** (Both protection surahs):
```
113→114: 95%  [HIGH - similar themes]
114→113: 93%  [HIGH - similar themes]
Asymmetry: 2%  [LOW - nearly symmetric]
```

**Why?** Both are short, focused surahs with nearly identical themes (seeking refuge).

### Strong Asymmetry

**Surah 2 ↔ 65** (Broad vs focused):
```
2→65: 55%   [LOWER - much of 2 not in 65]
65→2: 92%   [HIGH - most of 65 found in 2]
Asymmetry: 37%  [HIGH - strongly asymmetric]
```

**Why?** 
- Surah 2 (286 verses): Covers faith, prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, divorce, inheritance, war ethics
- Surah 65 (12 verses): Focused only on divorce
- Most of 65's content exists in 2's divorce section
- Much of 2's content has nothing to do with divorce

### Moderate Similarity

**Surah 10 ↔ 11** (Similar prophetic narratives):
```
10→11: 82%  [HIGH - similar themes]
11→10: 85%  [HIGH - similar themes]
Asymmetry: 3%  [LOW - nearly symmetric]
```

**Why?** Both are Makkan surahs with similar length and theme (prophetic stories).

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Sentence Splitting

For Quranic text, we use **verse-level** as the sentence unit:
- Each verse (ayah) is semantically complete
- Natural boundaries for meaning
- Corresponds to revelation units

**Important Exclusion**:
- The first verse (Bismillah: "بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ") is **skipped for all surahs except Surah 9**
- Reason: Bismillah is identical across 113 surahs and would artificially inflate similarity
- Surah 9 (At-Tawbah) doesn't start with Bismillah, so no exclusion needed
- Total verses analyzed: **6,123** (6,236 - 113 Bismillahs)

### Embedding Model

**Default** 🆕: `aubmindlab/bert-base-arabertv02` (AraBERT)
- 768-dimensional vectors
- **Trained on Classical Arabic & Quranic texts**
- Optimized for Arabic morphology and root system
- BERT architecture with contextual understanding
- **Produces 99%+ similarity scores** (captures deep thematic unity)

**Alternative**: `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` (Multilingual)
- General multilingual model
- Produces 89-95% scores (good but less Arabic-specific)
- Faster but less accurate for Classical Arabic

**Why AraBERT is Default**: See [AraBERT Integration](../ARABERT_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed comparison showing 5-10% improvement over multilingual models

### Computational Complexity

For 114 surahs:
- **Encoding**: O(N × S) where N = # surahs, S = avg sentences per surah
- **Similarity**: O(N² × S²) for full matrix

**Optimization**:
- Pre-compute all sentence embeddings (done once)
- Cache embeddings for reuse
- Vectorized cosine similarity (NumPy)
- Parallel processing possible

**Runtime**: ~20-30 minutes for full 114×114 matrix on modern CPU

---

## 📈 Normalization

Asym-STS naturally produces scores in [0, 1] range:
- Cosine similarity: [-1, 1]
- Max of positive similarities: [0, 1]
- Average of maxes: [0, 1]

**Convert to percentage**: Multiply by 100 → [0%, 100%]

**Interpretation**:
- 90-100%: Very high coverage (nearly all content matches)
- 70-89%: High coverage (most content matches)
- 50-69%: Moderate coverage (some content matches)
- 30-49%: Low coverage (little content matches)
- 0-29%: Very low coverage (almost no matches)

---

## 🎓 Use Cases

### 1. Parent-Child Relationships

**Question**: Is Surah B a focused subset of Surah A?

**Check**:
- If Asym-STS(B→A) >> Asym-STS(A→B): Yes!
- Example: Surah 65 (divorce) ⊂ Surah 2 (comprehensive)

### 2. Thematic Coverage

**Question**: Which surah better covers the themes of another?

**Answer**: Compare directional scores
- Higher score indicates better coverage

### 3. Summarization Potential

**Question**: Can Surah A serve as a summary of Surah B?

**Check**:
- If Asym-STS(B→A) is high and A is shorter: Yes!

### 4. Redundancy Detection

**Question**: Do these surahs contain overlapping content?

**Check**:
- If both Asym-STS(A→B) and Asym-STS(B→A) are high: Yes!

## 🔍 Validation

### Expected Properties

1. **Self-similarity = 100%**: Asym-STS(A→A) should equal 100%
2. **Asymmetry for different lengths**: Long vs short surahs should show strong asymmetry
3. **Symmetry for similar surahs**: Same-length, same-theme surahs should be nearly symmetric
4. **Correlation with human judgment**: Should align with scholarly understanding of surah relationships

### Test Cases

```python
# Test 1: Self-similarity
assert analyzer.analyze_pair(1, 1)['a_to_b'] > 99.5

# Test 2: Asymmetry (long vs short)
result = analyzer.analyze_pair(2, 65)
assert result['b_to_a'] > result['a_to_b'] + 20  # Expect 20%+ difference

# Test 3: Symmetry (similar surahs)
result = analyzer.analyze_pair(113, 114)
assert result['asymmetry'] < 5  # Expect < 5% asymmetry
```

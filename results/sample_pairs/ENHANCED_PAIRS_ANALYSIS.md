## üìñ About Classical vs Modern Standard Arabic

### Is the Quran in Modern Standard Arabic?

**No, the Quran is in Classical Arabic (Quranic/Fus·∏•a Arabic), NOT Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).** However, the analysis models handle this appropriately:

#### Key Differences:

| Aspect | Classical Arabic (Quran) | Modern Standard Arabic |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Period** | 7th century CE | 19th century onward |
| **Vocabulary** | Archaic, poetic, religious | Contemporary, scientific, political |
| **Grammar** | Full case endings (i'rab) | Case endings often dropped in speech |
| **Style** | Highly rhetorical, poetic | More standardized, simpler |
| **Expressions** | Classical idioms, metaphors | Modern phrases, neologisms |

#### Why Our Analysis Still Works:

1. **AraBERT Model**: Trained on **Classical Arabic texts** including:
   - Quranic text
   - Hadith literature
   - Classical poetry and prose
   - Historical Islamic texts
   - This makes it specifically suitable for Quranic analysis!

2. **Multilingual Embeddings**: Language-agnostic semantic capture:
   - Focuses on meaning, not specific dialect
   - Works across Arabic varieties
   - Captures universal semantic patterns

3. **Root-Based Arabic**: Both Classical and MSA share:
   - Same trilateral root system (ŸÉ-ÿ™-ÿ®, etc.)
   - Core morphological patterns
   - Fundamental grammatical structures
   - This allows models to recognize related words

4. **Preprocessing Helps**: Our preprocessing:
   - Removes diacritics (which differ in Classical vs MSA usage)
   - Normalizes character variants
   - Focuses on semantic roots
   - Makes analysis more robust across varieties

**Conclusion**: While the Quran is Classical Arabic, the analysis models (especially AraBERT) are trained on Classical texts and capture the semantic patterns accurately. The high semantic similarity scores reflect genuine thematic connections in the Quranic text.

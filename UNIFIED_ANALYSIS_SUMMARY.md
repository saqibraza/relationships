# Unified Multi-Method Quran Semantic Analysis

## ✅ Complete Integration of All Analysis Methods

This document presents the **unified relationship matrix** that combines ALL analysis methods into a single comprehensive similarity score (0-100%).

---

## 🔬 Methods Integrated

The unified matrix combines **5 different NLP analysis methods**:

| Method | Weight | Mean Similarity | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **KL Divergence** | 30% | 15.61% | Word frequency distribution differences |
| **Bigrams** | 10% | 1.60% | 2-word phrase patterns |
| **Trigrams** | 10% | 1.06% | 3-word phrase patterns |
| **Sentence Embeddings** | 35% | 80.63% | Deep semantic meaning (multilingual transformers) |
| **AraBERT** | 15% | 82.42% | Arabic-specific contextual embeddings |

### Why These Weights?

- **35% Embeddings**: Highest weight because it captures deep semantic meaning
- **30% KL Divergence**: Strong statistical foundation for vocabulary analysis  
- **15% AraBERT**: Arabic-specific nuances and morphology
- **20% N-grams** (10% + 10%): Captures phrase patterns and local word order

**Formula**: `Unified Similarity = 0.30×KL + 0.10×Bigram + 0.10×Trigram + 0.35×Embeddings + 0.15×AraBERT`

## ⚖️ Top 10 Most Asymmetric Relationships (Unified)

| Rank | Relationship | Forward | Reverse | Asymmetry | Interpretation |
|------|--------------|---------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Surah 2 → 62 | 54.28% | 48.21% | **+6.07%** | Surah 2 encompasses Surah 62 |
| 2 | Surah 3 → 62 | 58.03% | 51.99% | **+6.05%** | Surah 3 contains Surah 62's themes |
| 3 | Surah 10 → 109 | 46.84% | 41.17% | **+5.67%** | Narrative encompasses brief surah |
| 4 | Surah 5 → 61 | 58.65% | 53.24% | **+5.41%** | Legislative to focused |
| 5 | Surah 4 → 98 | 55.57% | 50.20% | **+5.38%** | Comprehensive to specific |
| 6 | Surah 4 → 62 | 54.11% | 49.31% | **+4.80%** | Broad to narrow |

## 🎯 Key Insights from Unified Analysis

### 1. **Balanced Similarity Range**

The unified matrix shows a more balanced range (20-60%) compared to individual methods:
- KL Divergence alone: 5.93% - 40.26% (highly variable)
- Embeddings alone: 42.4% - 97.8% (very high)
- **Unified**: 20.60% - 59.47% (well-distributed)

This balanced range makes the scores more interpretable and discriminative.

### 2. **Central Hub Surahs**

Surahs with highest average unified similarity (most connected):
- **Surah 3 (Āl 'Imrān)**: Appears in 7/10 top similar pairs
- **Surah 5 (Al-Ma'idah)**: Strong legislative and faith connections
- **Surah 2 (Al-Baqarah)**: Foundational themes across many surahs

### 3. **Peripheral Surahs**

Surahs with lowest average unified similarity (most distinctive):
- **Surah 92 (Al-Layl)**: Unique night/day cosmic imagery
- **Surah 108 (Al-Kawthar)**: Shortest, focused message
- **Surah 114 (An-Nās)**: Specific refuge prayer format

### 4. **Multi-Method Validation**

The unified approach reveals relationships that individual methods might miss:
- Low vocabulary overlap (KL) but high semantic similarity (embeddings) = same concept, different words
- High phrase similarity (n-grams) reinforces vocabulary connections
- AraBERT captures Arabic-specific nuances missed by multilingual models

### 5. **Thematic Families Confirmed**

The unified matrix confirms distinct surah families:

#### Legislative/Community Cluster (55-59% internal similarity)
- Surahs 2, 3, 4, 5
- High scores across all methods
- Focus: laws, community, faith

#### Prophetic Narrative Cluster (57-59% internal similarity)
- Surahs 7, 10, 11, 12
- Strong semantic and vocabulary overlap
- Focus: prophet stories, historical lessons

#### Short Praise/Warning Cluster (25-35% internal similarity)
- Surahs 92, 99, 102, 105, 108, 114
- Lower unified scores but semantically connected
- Focus: eschatology, praise, warnings

import pandas as pd

# Load unified matrix
unified = pd.read_csv('unified_results/unified_similarity_matrix.csv', index_col=0)

# Find most similar surahs to Surah 2
surah_2_similarities = unified.loc['Surah 2'].sort_values(ascending=False)
print(surah_2_similarities.head(10))

# Find asymmetric relationships
asymmetry = unified - unified.T
most_asymmetric = np.abs(asymmetry).unstack().sort_values(ascending=False)
print(most_asymmetric.head(20))
```

# Example: Emphasize vocabulary over semantics
custom_weights = {
    'kl_divergence': 0.50,  # 50% weight on vocabulary
    'bigram': 0.15,
    'trigram': 0.15,
    'embeddings': 0.15,     # 15% on semantics
    'arabert': 0.05
